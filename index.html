            <h3>Exort</h3>

            </div>
            <p>I am currently developing a game engine by the name of Exort. This project will help me grow my understanding of the development of games and efficiency in programming.
            </p>
        </div>
          
        <div class="project">
            <h3>In Progress:</h3>
            <div class="project-images">
            <img src="slimes.png" alt="Project 1 Image 1">
            </div>
            <p>This is a project with small creatures that have AI brains exploring a map in order to find food to survive and reproduce, 
              furthering their lifespan and their bloodline.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Grounding:</h3>
            <div class="project-images">

            </div>
            <p>This game addresses mental health and panic attacks, bringing attention to what panic attacks are and how people can either deal with them, 
              or help people they know that have them.
            </p>

            <h3>Procedurally Generated Waves - Individual</h3>
            <div class="project-video">
              <video controls>
                <source src="wave_vid.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
              </video>
            </div>
            <p>I had the most fun developing this project, which involved the procedural generation of waves, while also adding a mesh that allows collisions. 
              There is also a mini-game in which you can shoot the orange cubes for points to progress to deeper levels. The purple cube's function is to demonstrate the colliders. </p>
          </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>OpenGL Chess - Individual</h3>
            <div class="project-images">

            <img src="chess_terrain.png" alt="Project 1 Image 2">
            </div>
            <p><br>Chess board, pieces, and terrain created with OpenGL. This project required plotting all vertices, positioning the objects once they're made, 
              creating an import method and using it for textures, applying said textures, and finally creating the terrain and the skybox around it all. 
              This is all done purely through C++.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Evolutionary Algorithms - Individual</h3>
            <div class="project-images">
                <img src="evolutionary_algorithm.png" alt="Project 1 Image 1">
            </div>
            <p><br>Using a Unity car racing game provided by Vega, I created an algorithm that evolves the cars to reach further distances in lower amounts of time, all while avoiding local optimums.</p>
          </div>

            <h3>Game Development and Math:</h3>
            <div class="project-images">
            <img src="math1.png" alt="Project 1 Image 1">
            <img src="unity_shape.png" alt="Project 1 Image 2">
            </div>
            <p>            
              <br>Math is beautiful. One of the benefits of being a game developer is the ability to see the visual effects of math in a virtual environment, 
              and experiment with the many variations of different algorithms and expressions. An example is seeing Wolfram's Elementary Cellular Automata on the left,
              and the generating of cubes in Unity world space at points that are described by an algorithm, on the right.</p>
